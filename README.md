# 🔐 Intrusion Detection System with Attack Simulation and SIEM

This project demonstrates a real-time Intrusion Detection System (IDS) integrated with attack simulation tools and a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system.

## ⚙️ Features
- Real-time log collection and alerting
- Simulated attacks: phishing, DDoS, brute force
- Log forwarding to centralized SIEM (Splunk/ELK)
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Linux)

## 🧪 Tools & Technologies
- Python, Bash
- Snort / Suricata
- Splunk / ELK Stack
- Wireshark
- Nmap, Hydra

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run IDS: `python main.py`
3. Simulate attacks using provided scripts
4. View logs in SIEM dashboard
